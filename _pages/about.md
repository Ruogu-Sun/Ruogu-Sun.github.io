# 🤵 ​Biography
I received my B.S. degree in **English** in Beiwai College, Beijing Foreign Studies University. I am currently working toward an M.S degree in **Management Science and Engineering** at International Business School, BFSU, where I am advised by Prof. Xi CHEN. 

My research interests include topics in
+ **Domain**
  + Operations Management
  + Optimization
  + Machine Learning
  + Transportation
  + Quantitative Marketing
+ **Techniques**
  + Big Data Analytics
  + Time Series Forecasting
  + Complex Network Theory
  + Statistical Inference
  + Stochastic Process & MDP

I am passionate about building **robust and interpretable models** to explain and solve real-world managerial and economic problems. I also crave **stochastic process model** and **cutting-edge machine/deep learning framework** that enable data-driven approaches in this world. As a life-long learner, I aspire to obtain a PhD seat and ultimately embark on a fulfilling career as a higher education educator.
