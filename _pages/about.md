# ü§µ ‚ÄãBiography [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EnSM47V9X2kPsUwaVzkPnFcHiFmMUMBX/view?usp=drive_link)
I received my B.A. in **English**, with a specification in Economics, in Beiwai College, Beijing Foreign Studies University. I am currently working toward an M.S. in **Management Science and Engineering** at International Business School, BFSU, where I am advised by Prof. Xi CHEN and Xiaosong DING. 

My research interests include topics in
+ **Domain**
  + Supply Chain Management
  + Inventory Control
  + Transportation
  + Decision Making
  + Machine Learning
+ **Techniques**
  + (Distributionally) Robust Optimization
  + Stochastic Process & MDP
  + Time Series Forecasting
  + Complex Network Theory
  + (Approximate) Dynamic Programming

Overall, I am passionate about building **robust and interpretable models** to explain and solve real-world managerial and economic problems. I also crave **stochastic process model** and **cutting-edge machine/deep learning framework** that enable data-driven approaches and inform decision making in this world. As a life-long learner, I aspire to obtain a PhD seat and ultimately embark on a fulfilling career as a higher education educator.

## Working Papers
+ Online Order Transfer Between Restaurants 

  + We consider a robust optimization problem in a multilocation restaurant chain with order transfer and inventory replenishment options available. Each restaurant must determine the optimal inventory level for foods-to-deliver to prepare in advance at every planning period over the (possibly infinite) horizon. The objective is to model the decision-making process that minimizes the expected total operational and delivery costs across locations while meeting uncertain customer demand. 

  + [Research Proposal(Last Update: 2024.12.04)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IbpePEcnACbcZ1F9OF7m6yrY2TIEN6ri/view?usp=sharing). Check here for a detailed PDF, this is ongoing. I have opened the comment function. Please feel free to leave any comments. They are extremely valuable to me!
