# â€‹Biography [CV Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvNFQ-4Dr4p2tIRbC5U22v8v9ZrTD2GN/view?usp=sharing)
I am currently working toward an M.S. in **Management Science and Engineering** at International Business School, BFSU, where I am advised by Prof. Xi CHEN and Xiaosong DING. 

Overall, I am passionate about building **robust and interpretable models** to
1. explain and solve real-world managerial and economic problems.
2. enable data-driven approaches and inform decision making in this world.
3. understand agents behaviors, individually and collectively.

With that, my research interests include topics in
+ **Domain** Supply Chain Management; Inventory Control; Transportation; Decision Making.
+ **Techniques** (Distributionally) Robust Optimization; Stochastic Process & MDP; Time Series Forecasting; (Approximate) Dynamic Programming; Machine Learning.

# Research Experiences


## Working Papers
+ Multi-period Robust Inventory Management with Demand Transfers 

  + We consider a multi-period robust inventory delivery problem in a network with two installations where inventory replenishment and demand transfer options available. Each installation must determine the optimal inventory level for order-to-deliver by replenishment at every planning period, and leverages demand transfer mechanism if necessary. The objective is to model the decision-making process that minimizes the total operational and delivery costs while meeting uncertain customer demand
